As example, `CircularJSON.stringify(data, null, null, true)` can produce an output with `\"[Circular]\"` placeholder as other implementations might do.\n\n\n### Dependencies\nA proper **JSON** object must be globally available if the browser/engine does not support it.\n\nDependencies free if you target IE8 and greater or any server side JS engine.\n\nBear in mind `JSON.parse(CircularJSON.stringify(object))` will work but not produce the expected output.\n\nIt is also *a bad idea* to `CircularJSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))` because of those manipulation used in `CircularJSON.stringify()` able to make parsing safe and secure.\n\nAs summary: `CircularJSON.parse(CircularJSON.stringify(object))` is the way to go, same is for `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))`.\n\n\n### Which Version\nThe usual structure for my repos, the one generated via [gitstrap](https://github.com/WebReflection/gitstrap), so:\n\n  * all browsers, generic, as [global CircularJSON object](build/circular-json.js)\n  * [node.js module](build/circular-json.node.js), also via `npm install circular-json` and later on `var CircularJSON = require('circular-json')`\n  * [AMD module](build/circular-json.amd.js) loader, as CircularJSON object\n\nThe **API** is the **same as JSON Object** so nothing new to learn here while [full test coverage](test/circular-json.js) is also in the usual place with some example included.\n\n\n### Why Not the [@izs](https://twitter.com/izs) One\nThe module [json-stringify-safe](https://github.com/isaacs/json-stringify-safe) seems to be for `console.log()`  but it's completely pointless for `JSON.parse()`, being latter one unable to retrieve back the initial structure. Here an example:\n\n```JavaScript\n// a logged object with circular references\n{\n  \"circularRef\": \"[Circular]\",\n  \"list\": [\n    \"[Circular]\",\n    \"[Circular]\"\n  ]\n}\n// what do we do with above output ?\n```\n\nJust type this in your `node` console: `var o = {}; o.a = o; console.log(o);`. The output will be `{ a: [Circular] }` ... good, but that ain't really solving the problem.\n\nHowever, if that's all you need, the function used to create that kind of output is probably faster than `CircularJSON` and surely fits in less lines of code.\n\n\n### Why Not {{put random name}} Solution\nSo here the thing: circular references can be wrong but, if there is a need for them, any attempt to ignore them or remove them can be considered just a failure.\n\nNot because the method is bad or it's not working, simply because the circular info, the one we needed and used in the first place, is lost!\n\nIn this case, `CircularJSON` does even more than just solve circular and recursions: it maps all same objects so that less memory is used as well on deserialization as less bandwidth too!\nIt's able to redefine those references back later on so the way we store is the way we retrieve and in a reasonably performant way, also trusting the snappy and native `JSON` methods to iterate.",
