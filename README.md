#Children's Fund of San Mateo County

##Background

The Children's Fund of San Mateo County is a government organization which serves the underprivileged children of San Mateo.

One function of the Children's Fund is to facilitate gift donations between donors and kids. About four thousand children are helped per year, but the existing "paper and excel" infrastructure is proving to be a major blocking point.

In two weeks, we created a cutting edge full-stack application from scratch which streamlines the donations process and greatly reduces the workload of the Children's Fund staff.

##Tech Stack

Front-end:

 - Angular.js

Back-end:

 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - MySQL + Sequelize ORM
