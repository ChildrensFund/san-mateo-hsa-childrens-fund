###Child Data Panes
A child's first and last name, CFID, and pledge status are visible on the headings of the expandable data panes.  Click a child's name to see detailed data.

>Children's Fund Identification Number (CFID): Used for tracking incoming donations.  **This is the donor's confirmation number.**

###Set HSA Status
Click the drop-down menu and select the appropriate status.
>This menu only appears if a donor has pledged to that child.  

###Unpledge Button
