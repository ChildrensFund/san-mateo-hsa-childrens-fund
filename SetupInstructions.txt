1. In terminal issue the command: chmod 777 server/reports
  MySQL needs write access to the folder to generate reports

2. In node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/abstract/query.js, add

  if(this.options.outfile){
    return;
  }

  Above the //raw queries on line 217. This is to fix a Sequelize bug
  which didn't account for logfile exporting. Specifically, sequelize
  is always expecting a set from MySQL, but logfiles only send back an
  OK response. As there's no set to work with, when sequelize attempts
  to call set.map, it throws an error. My fix simply prevents further
  action since there's nothing left to do.
